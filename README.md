### Dan's GitHub Profile

I do a lot of development in Go, but I'm familiar with Javascript, Node, React, and Python.
Like most devs, I've also got Rust on my bucket list.

I'm interested in big challenges - learning new domains, designing distributed systems, building teams, and planning + executing complex projects with tight deadlines.
I make sure the work gets done!
